# Train-Scheduler

- What the project does

This project is a Train Scheduler. It allows a user to enter a Train Name, Destination, Train Time, and Frequency of Arrival. The inputs will then post to the Train Information container, and also send the data over to firebase. The minutes to arrival will update every minute based off of the Current Time. 

- Why the project is useful

This project is useful because it utilizes firebase and moment.js, which is the first project that I have built that utilizes these. It builds on existing knowledge and also incorporates these new features that we have been learning. 

- How users can get started with the project

Users should build their initial files and repo for github. Build a basic HTML layout with a table for the train data, and a form input container to capture the users input. In your javascript file, begin by linking your work to firebase. Make sure to utilize console.logs, as well as do some test on sending your data to firebase to ensure that it is working properly. Start by making the user input not only display to the table, but also to firebase. The tricky part for myself was getting the moment.js functionality to work. Make sure to read the documentation and find examples online. 

- Where users can get help with your project

Users can find help on github, stack overflow, w3 schools, MDN, jquery, moment.js, bootstrap. Also google as always is a great tool for specific problems you may run across.
